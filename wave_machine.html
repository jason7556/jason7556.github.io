    	      <br>

              In the beginning, I intuitively tried to mimic the sound of sea waves since I just love that loud but tranquil sound. I utilized some mechanical methods to let the plate ,which is at the top of the installation, ups and downs so that steel ball on the plate can keep rolling around and produce the sea wavesʼ sound. After it operate a small amount of time, I aware there are several orbital traces left on the plate. I think it is quite interesting so I start to color the steel balls and let the pigmented balls to “paint” on the surface.<br><br>
              -<br><br>
              Although all the things Iʼve encountered are seemingly irrelevant, however, in retrospect, I realized that those things were running in an orbital trajectory which will lead me toward the shape I want myself to become. After all, only experience once by myself can I fathom these things.
