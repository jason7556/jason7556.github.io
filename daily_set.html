    	      <p class="daily_set_paragraph">This series of works are narrating about myself. The mechanic structure with perpetual movement elucidates my everyday non-stop hands. I want to utilize simple methods to delineate the unconsciously behavior of my hands.<br>
              <br>
              - Lift<br>
              - Wank<br>
              - Type<br>
              - Press<br><br>
              Why I made installations of actions?<br><br>
              I made this series of works in order to introduce myself. I started to think-- what can represent me? I found that there is a slang word in Chinese called ”signature move”, which refers to a person constantly do some action, when he/she doing that action, others can recognize it as their representation. Therefore, I deem that I could make a series of “actions”, which can delineates me.<br><br>
              Why these four actions?<br><br>
              The question is-- which action should I made. I must figure out what is my signature move.<br><br>
              1) I meticulously observed my surrounding and list those objects I frequently used.<br>
              2) In order to realized the frequency of my actions, I need to visualize it. So I bought a pedometer and attached on the selected object to count how many times I exert such particular action. Each experiment was completed in 8 hours when I stayed at home.
